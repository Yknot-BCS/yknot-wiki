# 🐙 Github Basics

## Github commands

These commands will be used during your development cycle within VSCode. All the commands can be viewed and used by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P within VSCode.

## Commands and descriptions

* **Git fetch** -> Checks the remote repo and compares it to your local repo. This is done with the current branch your are working on. This will display how many commits you are behind compared to the remote branch within left bottom corner of VSCode.
* **Git pull** -> Pulls all the commits that is on the remote repo to your local repo on the current branch you are working on. This essentially synchronizes your local branch to the most updated remote branch.
* **Git checkout** -> Used to work on a specific branch or create and work on that specific branch. Jira provides the checkout command that you can paste into your gitbash terminal once you created a branch from Jira.
* **Git publish** -> If you created a branch on your local machine this command will push the newly created branch on your local repo to the remote repo.
* **Git merge** -> Allows you to merge all the commits from one branch into another specified branch.
* **Git push** -> All the staged commits that are on your local branch that are not yet on the remote branch are then added to the remote branch.

These commands are the most commonly used. There are numerous other available commands to use.
