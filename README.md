## Getting started

“A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.” ― Lao Tzu

The first thing you need to do is get access to Discord, Telegram, GitHub and Jira. We use GitHub for version control and to store our code in repositories. Jira is a project management tool that integrates with GitHub to keep track of outstading and completed work. We chat formally on Telegram and informally on Discord.

Make sure we've added you on those platforms and get right into it with:

* [CPanel Email Setup](resources/cpanel-email.md)
* [First day installs](resources/day-1/)

## Getting it done

Wherever you are on your journey to harness the potential of blockchain technology, we’re here to guide you.

We’re continuously building our library of resources to give you the information you need to make good choices along the way.

Here the crew likes to share things that they found useful. We heartily encourage contribution. Just make ye pull request.
