# :fist: Agile Project Management
We follow these [principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html):

- Our highest priority is to **satisfy the customer** through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development. 
- Agile processes **harness change** for the customer's competitive advantage.
- **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must **work together daily** throughout the project.
- Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and **trust** them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**.
- **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote **sustainable development**. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to **maintain a constant pace** indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to **technical excellence and good design** enhances agility.
- Simplicity--**the art of maximizing the amount of work not done**--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
- At regular intervals, the team **reflects on how to become more effective**, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

# 🤼 Scrum
We use the [scrum method](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) on many of our time-based projects. It is one of many methods based on the Agile principles. Here is how it works: 


## :clipboard: 1.	Project Backlog
A **prioritized list of work** that needs to get done. The list is maintained by the **product owner** (will be one of our full-time crew members). 
This is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that acts as the input for the sprint backlog. It is, essentially, **the team’s “To Do” list**.

## 🏃 2.	Sprint
A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to **complete a set amount of work**.  
**One to two weeks** is a pretty typical length for a sprint. 

The development team (this is you 👈) pulls work from the backlog as there is capacity for it. 
Before each sprint starts there will be a sprint meeting, in which the team decides **who will do what**. 

## :calendar: 3. Sprint meetings (stand-ups)
A super-short meeting that happens at the same time every few days. Many teams try to complete the meeting in 15 minutes - as if they could do it without sitting down (hence the name: stand-up). 
Be prepared to comment on these 3 questions in every sprint meeting:
-  What did I do since our last meeting?
- What do I plan to do until our next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles that will keep me from completing my tasks?
