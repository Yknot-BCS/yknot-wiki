# Invoicing & Time Tracking

### Time Tracking

Every developer needs to keep track of what they spend their development time on by logging their time on [Clockify](https://app.clockify.me/en/login). Take note that we use Clockify optimally by integrating it with our Jira projects. To do this, please refer to the following guide:

Every Jira Issue will have the option of clocking your development time using a 'Start/Stop' type of functionality (see below)

Following this approach automatically syncs your jira tasks with specific clockify projects, which make it easier to consolidate when having to pay out your salary, so do it right :wink:.

### Invoices

* All contractors & holiday crew email their clockify reports & invoices to [gideon@y-knot.io](mailto:gideon@y-knot.io) by the 25th of each month
* Invoices should span from the 25th of the previous month to the 24th of the current month (eg. 25 May to 24 June)
* Late invoices will be paid at the end of the following month
* If you need something to make nice invoices with, try [Invoicely](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari\&rls=en\&q=invoicely\&ie=UTF-8\&oe=UTF-8)
