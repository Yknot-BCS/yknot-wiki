# Project Management

Y-knot Blockchain Solutions operates in an extremely volatile and uncertain environment and thus requires a project management methodology which is adaptable, not very administrative in nature and easy to adopt with the onboarding of new employees and sub-contractors.&#x20;

To ease the process of managing projects and development resources, software development projects will be tackled using the SCRUM project methodology. This methodology requires teams to be flexible and self-organizing in nature, being able to decide who in the team would be the best fit for every SCRUM Role, for a specified project. The focus is delivering value to the customer. This model is designed to maximize productivity, creativity and flexibility.

Products are to be delivered incrementally and iteratively to maximize feedback opportunities from external stakeholders.&#x20;

### ðŸ“ˆ Development Process

Venture with us into the unknown. We know the ropes when it comes to building blockchain-based solutions

Our software development lifecycle usually looks like this:

1. Gather requirements
2. Design the solution - System Architecture & UX/UI Design
3. Development (this is usally where you will start your collab)
4. Testing for errors - share it with clients to test our
5. Documentation & user guides
6. Maintenance & upgrades

## How do we do it?

Our methodology (although not fixed) is [agile](agile.md), we put into practice with Jira. We managed our codebase with [Github](agile-1.md).

When you have reached the documentation step of the development process and learned something useful that the whole crew should know, we want you to update the Yknot Wiki via Gitbook. In order to edit the Gitbook go [here](https://www.gitbook.com/). Do not choose sign up with Github, this will not give you access to the Gitbook. Rather sign in with docs@y-knot.io a sign-in email with a link will be sent to your @y-knot.io email address. If you did accedentally sign up with Github, then just clear the cache of your browser and try again.
