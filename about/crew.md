### Connection

Our team connection and relationships are crucial to being a successful development company. We believe that every individual has God-given talents and skills that they need to bring to the table.

We work in a fully remote environment and trust one another to do what is best for the company, and manage themselves well. We prioritise 2-weekly in-person gatherings in Pretoria to work, eat and exercise together. It is important that we all look after ourselves, and after one another, to run as far as we are able to fnish the race entrusted to us. So be you, and do it freely. Bring all you have to offer. Who knows...we might sail to the ends of the Earth.
