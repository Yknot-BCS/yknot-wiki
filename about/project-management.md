# Project Management

Y-knot Blockchain Solutions operates in an extremely volatile and uncertain environment and thus requires a project management methodology which is adaptable, not very administrative in nature and easy to adopt with the onboarding of new employees and sub-contractors.&#x20;

To ease the process of managing projects and development resources, software development projects will be tackled using the SCRUM project methodology. This methodology requires teams to be flexible and self-organizing in nature, being able to decide who in the team would be the best fit for every SCRUM Role, for a specified project. The focus is delivering value to the customer. This model is designed to maximize productivity, creativity and flexibility.

Products are to be delivered incrementally and iteratively to maximize feedback opportunities from external stakeholders.&#x20;

### SCRUM Roles

**Product Owner**

* A single individual accountable to maximize the value of a product being developed by the development team.
* Accountable for the management of the product backlog.
* Responsible for communication with all stakeholders outside of the SCRUM Team.

**SCRUM Master**

* Promote and support SCRUM users by teaching them on correct practices and applications of the SCRUM methodology.
* Responsible to interact with team members and external stakeholders on the importance of the SCRUM methodology.&#x20;
* Offers services to Product Owner**.**

**Development Team**

* Set of professionals responsible for developing products and product releases in increments defined as ‘Sprints’.&#x20;
* The development team must be self-organizing to the point where the Scrum Master can’t give any mandate on how to develop functions and features on the product backlog.
* Cross-functional in nature, improving the effectivity of the team.

### Project Execution

Projects will be broken down into smaller manageable tasks, referred to as ‘Epics’, that will be further broken down into manageable tasks referred to as ‘Issues’. Issues are listed in a backlog and completed in ‘Sprints’, as given through by the product owner during project prioritization discussions. This will be managed on project management software and kept up to date by the scrum managers of the different projects.&#x20;

A crucial part of the SRUM methodology is a daily SCRUM discussion within the SCRUM team where they discuss how the previous day’s work went, and what will be prioritized for that day in order to still reach the Sprint goal within the planned timeframe.

After every Sprint has been completed, a short discussion can be held by the SCRUM team to reflect on what worked well and what didn’t, to promote effectivity and team cohesion for future sprints.
