# Project Management

Y-knot Blockchain Solutions operates in an extremely volatile and uncertain environment and thus requires a project management methodology which is adaptable, not very administrative in nature and easy to adopt with the onboarding of new employees and sub-contractors.&#x20;

To ease the process of managing projects and development resources, software development projects will be tackled using the SCRUM project methodology. This methodology requires teams to be flexible and self-organizing in nature, being able to decide who in the team would be the best fit for every SCRUM Role, for a specified project. The focus is delivering value to the customer. This model is designed to maximize productivity, creativity and flexibility.

Products are to be delivered incrementally and iteratively to maximize feedback opportunities from external stakeholders.&#x20;

### üìà Development Process

Venture with us into the unknown. We know the ropes when it comes to building blockchain-based solutions

Our software development lifecycle usually looks like this:

1. Gather requirements
2. Design the solution - System Architecture & UX/UI Design
3. Development (this is usally where you will start your collab)
4. Testing for errors - share it with clients to test our
5. Documentation & user guides
6. Maintenance & upgrades

## :fist: Agile Project Management

We follow these [principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html):

* Our highest priority is to **satisfy the customer** through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development.
* Agile processes **harness change** for the customer's competitive advantage.
* **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must **work together daily** throughout the project.
* Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and **trust** them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**.
* **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile processes promote **sustainable development**. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to **maintain a constant pace** indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to **technical excellence and good design** enhances agility.
* Simplicity--**the art of maximizing the amount of work not done**--is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
* At regular intervals, the team **reflects on how to become more effective**, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## ü§º Scrum

We use the [scrum method](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) on many of our time-based projects. It is one of many methods based on the Agile principles. Here is how it works:

### :clipboard: 1. Project Backlog

A **prioritized list of work** that needs to get done. The list is maintained by the **product owner** (will be one of our full-time crew members). This is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that acts as the input for the sprint backlog. It is, essentially, **the team‚Äôs ‚ÄúTo Do‚Äù list**.

### üèÉ 2. Sprint

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to **complete a set amount of work**.\
**One to two weeks** is a pretty typical length for a sprint.

> "Sprints make projects more manageable, allow teams to ship high-quality work faster and more frequently, and gives them more flexibility to adapt to change." [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints)

The development team (this is you üëà) pulls work from the backlog as there is capacity for it. Before each sprint starts there will be a sprint meeting, in which the team decides **who will do what**.

### :calendar: 3. Sprint meetings (stand-ups)

A super-short meeting that happens at the same time every few days.

> "In many sports the team huddles before each play. The huddle is strategic: it keeps the team informed, connected, and calibrated throughout the game. For software teams, the stand-up is like the team‚Äôs huddle. It‚Äôs even commonly known as the daily scrum, and reinforces ‚Äúwe‚Äù to keep everyone aware of the team‚Äôs landscape and progress." [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups)

Be prepared to comment on these 3 questions in every sprint meeting:

* What did I do since our last meeting?
* What do I plan to do until our next meeting?
* Are there any obstacles that will keep me from completing my tasks?

### SCRUM Roles

**Product Owner**

* A single individual accountable to maximize the value of a product being developed by the development team.
* Accountable for the management of the product backlog.
* Responsible for communication with all stakeholders outside of the SCRUM Team.

**SCRUM Master**

* Promote and support SCRUM users by teaching them on correct practices and applications of the SCRUM methodology.
* Responsible to interact with team members and external stakeholders on the importance of the SCRUM methodology.&#x20;
* Offers services to Product Owner**.**

**Development Team**

* Set of professionals responsible for developing products and product releases in increments defined as ‚ÄòSprints‚Äô.&#x20;
* The development team must be self-organizing to the point where the Scrum Master can‚Äôt give any mandate on how to develop functions and features on the product backlog.
* Cross-functional in nature, improving the effectivity of the team.

### Project Execution

Projects will be broken down into smaller manageable tasks, referred as ‚ÄòIssues‚Äô and grouped into differnt categories referred to as 'Epics'. Issues are listed in a backlog and completed in ‚ÄòSprints‚Äô, as given through by the product owner during project prioritization discussions. This will be managed on project management software and kept up to date by the scrum managers of the different projects.&#x20;

A crucial part of the SRUM methodology is a regular SCRUM discussion within the SCRUM team where they discuss how the previous time period's work went, and what will be prioritized for the next period in order to still reach the Sprint goal within the planned timeframe.

After every Sprint has been completed, a short discussion can be held by the SCRUM team to reflect on what worked well and what didn‚Äôt, to promote effectivity and team cohesion for future sprints.

### Project Management Software

We use [Jira](https://y-knotbcs.atlassian.net/jira/your-work) to manage our development projects. Every software solution has its own Jira Project and is setup by the Product Owner and Lead Developer. All of the issues listed in the product backlog and grouped into Sprints, planned ahead to ensure successful product delivery at the planned due date.

## üìú Guidelines

Here we list a few practical considerations that we found useful.

### üëç Good practice

* Do time or difficulty (story point) estimation before starting with a task; keep track of your time; and compare with your estimate afterwards.
* Notify and remind reviewers about pull-requests.
* Do issue status updates before the scrum session.
* Pull-requests should not be left open longer than 10 hours.
* Scrum sessions should be kept short. In general, only talk about things that concerns at least half of the group.
* Each pull-request should only include a single task.
* Close branches after merging a pull-request.
* Jump on the next task if you are blocked on a specific task.
* Feel free to take issues from the backlog if you are done with your set of assigned issues.
* Commit messages should have the following format:
  * Start with the category:
    * feat - New features
    * fix - Bug fixes
    * chore - Refactoring, editor configs etc.
    * style - Not functionality, eg. CSS
    * wip - Work in progress
  * Then a description of what you have done.
  * Example: `feat: add navbar`

### üêô Github integration

When we do project management on Jira, we like to create a new branch for every new issue. This makes it easier to track the task. All you need to do is to follow the correct naming convention for new branches.

Start your branch name with the issue code and then the issue title, divided by dashes. For example `LEG-230-setup`.

Jira simplifies the process by providing you with a line that you can paste in your terminal to do it for you. See the an example in the image below.
