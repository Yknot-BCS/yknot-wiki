## :chart\_with\_upwards\_trend: Agile Project Management

We follow these [principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html):

* Our highest priority is to **satisfy the customer** through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development.
* Agile processes **harness change** for the customer's competitive advantage.
* **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must **work together daily** throughout the project.
* Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and **trust** them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**.
* **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile processes promote **sustainable development**. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to **maintain a constant pace** indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to **technical excellence and good design** enhances agility.
* Simplicity--**the art of maximizing the amount of work not done**--is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
* At regular intervals, the team **reflects on how to become more effective**, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## 🤼 Scrum

We use the [scrum method](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) on many of our time-based projects. It is one of many methods based on the Agile principles. Here is how it works:

### :clipboard: 1. Project Backlog

A **prioritized list of work** that needs to get done. The list is maintained by the **product owner** (will be one of our full-time crew members). This is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that acts as the input for the sprint backlog. It is, essentially, **the team’s “To Do” list**.

### 🏃 2. Sprint

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to **complete a set amount of work**.\
**One to two weeks** is a pretty typical length for a sprint.

> "Sprints make projects more manageable, allow teams to ship high-quality work faster and more frequently, and gives them more flexibility to adapt to change." [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints)

The development team (this is you 👈) pulls work from the backlog as there is capacity for it. Before each sprint starts there will be a sprint meeting, in which the team decides **who will do what**.

### :calendar: 3. Sprint meetings (stand-ups)

A super-short meeting that happens at the same time every few days.

> "In many sports the team huddles before each play. The huddle is strategic: it keeps the team informed, connected, and calibrated throughout the game. For software teams, the stand-up is like the team’s huddle. It’s even commonly known as the daily scrum, and reinforces “we” to keep everyone aware of the team’s landscape and progress." [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups)

Be prepared to comment on these 3 questions in every sprint meeting:

* What did I do since our last meeting?
* What do I plan to do until our next meeting?
* Are there any obstacles that will keep me from completing my tasks?

## 📜 Guidelines

Here we list a few practical considerations that we found useful.

### 👍 Good practice

* Do time or difficulty (story point) estimation before starting with a task; keep track of your time; and compare with your estimate afterwards.
* Do issue status updates before the scrum session.
* Scrum sessions should be kept short. In general, only talk about things that concerns at least half of the group.
* Jump on the next task if you are blocked on a specific task.
* Feel free to take issues from the backlog if you are done with your set of assigned issues.

### 🐙 Github integration

When we do project management on Jira, we like to create a new branch for every new issue. This makes it easier to track the task. All you need to do is to follow the [correct naming convention for new branches](agile-1.md).

Start your branch name with the issue code and then the issue title, divided by dashes. For example `LEG-230-setup`.

Jira simplifies the process by providing you with a line that you can paste in your terminal to do it for you. See the an example in the image below.
